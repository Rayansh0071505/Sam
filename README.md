## Welcome Today i will introduce to you Mrs. Sam , She is virtual assistant bot which will help you to interact with users

I have used these Modules
<li>
  <ul>  Speech Recognition</ul></li>
<li>  <ul> pyaudio</ul></li>
 <li> <ul> gtts</ul>
  <ul> playsound</ul>
  <ul> os</ul>
  <ul> English-to-Hindi</ul>
  <ul> webbrowser</ul>
  <li> time </li>

my project directly interact with user for example if user can and want to browse files or options it can directly says to machine and it will direct it to that place

i havent used now but in future we will use Named Entity Recognition with the help of named entity recognition we can see what user want as It is what allows the bot to accurately identify entities in the inputted text such as date, time, location, quantities, names and product

in india we have only 75 million population speaking english so if organisation like Vakeelsearch want to cover every corner our bot can help where it uses nltk and
As a first step, we use Automatic Speech Recognition to convert the user's speech to text. Using Natural Language Processing, we decipher the transcribed text, take appropriate actions, and compose a text response.

In this stage, we should include functionality for managing dialogues and generating natural language. With speech processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning, intelligent devices, such as smartphones, can communicate with their users verbally.


for now just imitating the real project i have used <b>  English-to-Hindi </b> module 


for sentimental analysis - Transfer learning, i.e. fine-tuning a pretrained language model for text classification, can be used if some data is available in the target language. if we don't have any available data in the target language. we need to Find some data in any language but of the same domain that you want to build the system for, and use zero-shot multilingual transfer
