## Welcome Today i will introduce to you Mrs. Sam , She is virtual assistant bot which directly interact with users and assist them

I have used these Modules
  <li>Speech Recognition</li>
  <li>pyaudio</li>
 <li> gtts</li>
  <li>  playsound</li>
 <li> os </li>
 <li> English-to-Hind </li>
  <li>webbrowser</li>
my project directly interact with user for example if user can and want to browse files or options it can directly says to machine and it will direct it to that place

i havent used now but in future we will use Named Entity Recognition with the help of named entity recognition we can see what user want as It is what allows the bot to accurately identify entities in the inputted text such as date, time, location, quantities, names and product

in india we have only 75 million population speaking english so if organisation like legal organisation want to cover every corner our bot can help where it uses nltk and
As a first step, we use Automatic Speech Recognition to convert the user's speech to text. Using Natural Language Processing, we decipher the transcribed text, take appropriate actions, and compose a text response.

In this stage, we should include functionality for managing dialogues and generating natural language. With speech processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning, intelligent devices, such as smartphones, can communicate with their users verbally.


for now just imitating the real project i have used <b>  English-to-Hindi </b> module 


for sentimental analysis - Transfer learning, i.e. fine-tuning a pretrained language model for text classification, can be used if some data is available in the target language. but we don't have any available data in the target language. we need to Find some data in any language but of the same domain that we want to build the system for, and use zero-shot multilingual transfer, the main game here which play game is <b>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) </b>that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset(here the data set can be voice_data(in code))

Acoustic modeling, which represents the which phonemes were pronounced and what are the words these phonemes complete. for grammer purpose Pronunciation modeling, that analyzes the way phonemes are pronounced, is there any accent or other peculiarities of the vocal apparatus to capture the phonetic variability of speech. and Language modeling, which is aimed at finding contextual probabilities depending on what phonemes were captured!


currently the problem is that its just a imitation of that but in future i will make it as i dont have acquired knowledge till......



<b><h2>What my model can do if it include in website? </b></h2> its currently phase
<li>bot will first address the user
<li>than bot will ask what user wants to do
<li>for example if user wants to do registration if ipo it will ask machine register
<li>the bot will confirm it
<li>after user can confirm it (user can confirm in local language also)
<li>bot will redirect user to that v ipo registration page

<li>apart from legal advice if user want to know about right of person with disability or search anything on google or any other rights it can redirect it through that

we have also introduced one case where if user enter he want to marry but he is below 18 our bot can direct him to that respected page and give him advice related to it

<i><h5>its just imitation but in future with help of Â Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) ,transfer learning i.e. finetune a pretrained language model for text classification. and Named Entity Recognition we can evolve this bot to another level where it will be like virtual assistant where there is no hard code coding will be needed and no human interaction will be there and user can talk in his local language ,</i>

<h3> it will take me some time , but i am sure it will be done </h3>
